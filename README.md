# Lean Cereal #

## Synopsis ##

Lean cereal is an effort to serialize the "lean canvas" style of condensed
business plan.  To find out more about the lean canvas concept see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Canvas "Wikipedia Lean Canvas Article"). Lean cereal uses the YAML markup language
to structure the information. YAML strives to be both human writable and machine readable,
see [here](http://www.yaml.org "yaml.org") for information on the syntax.
